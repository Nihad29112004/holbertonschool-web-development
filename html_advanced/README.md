# HTML Advanced - Holberton School

## 📖 Project Overview
In this project and the upcoming ones, you will implement a webpage **from scratch** based on a designer file.  
For this first project, the focus is on the **HTML structure only** — no CSS, no styling, just **pure semantic HTML**.

The designer file is available on **Figma**. You can create a free account to access the final result:

- **Page in Figma**: [Link to Figma file]  
- Click **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to access all design details.

### Important notes about Figma:
- If your computer doesn’t have the required fonts, you can find them here: **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin-Cycle-OT**.  
- Some values in the design may be in float — feel free to round them.
